# GTFS Example Feed Documentation
This document provides a simple, easy-to-understand overview of the GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) example feed from Google Developers. It includes comma-delimited data samples, field descriptions, and key explanations for each GTFS file.

## Overview
The GTFS example feed consists of multiple comma-separated value (CSV) files that define transit system details (e.g., agencies, routes, stops, schedules). The sample files below illustrate the structure and content of a standard GTFS feed. A complete, downloadable version of the feed is available for practical use.

## Key Notes
- All files are comma-delimited (CSV) and use standard GTFS field names.
- Optional fields are left blank (e.g., `agency_phone` in the second `agency.txt` entry).
- Time values use HH:MM:SS format (24-hour clock; times exceeding 24:00:00 are allowed for trips spanning midnight).
- Date values use YYYYMMDD format (e.g., 20060701 = July 1, 2006).
- The sample files are not all related to the same transit system (for demonstration purposes only). A complete, consistent GTFS feed is available for download from the original webpage.
